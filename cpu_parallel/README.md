# Expanse-Notebooks-dev : cpu_parallel
This is a notebook collections of parallel in cPU using dask,mkl.  CPU is a powerful technique that can lead to significant improvements in performance, scalability, and resource utilization. By executing multiple tasks simultaneously, applications can handle larger workloads, respond more quickly, and make better use of modern multi-core CPU architectures.
