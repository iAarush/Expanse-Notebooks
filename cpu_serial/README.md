# Expanse-Notebooks-dev: CPU_Serial
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that run on CPU and Serial configurations. Serial processing executes tasks one at a time in a fixed order, ensuring that each task completes before the next begins. This approach simplifies implementation and management, making it ideal for systematic data analysis and computation.
