# Expanse-Notebooks-dev: CPU_Serial

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks designed to run on CPU with serial processing configurations. Serial processing executes tasks sequentially, one at a time, in a fixed order. Each task must fully complete before the next one starts, which generally results in slower performance compared to parallel processing. However, serial processing uses fewer system resources, as it relies on a single thread or processor to handle tasks, making it efficient for simpler workloads.
