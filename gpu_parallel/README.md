# Expanse-Notebooks-dev: gpu_parallel

GPU parallel computing distinguishes GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) from CPUs (Central Processing Units). It refers to a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously, known as parallel processing.

In this folder, you will find notebooks that explore various aspects of GPU parallel computing, including Numba, CuPy, cuDF, Dask, and TensorFlow.
