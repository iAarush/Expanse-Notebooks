# Session 5.3b Deep Learning â€“ Part 2

**Date:** Thursday, August 10, 2023

**Summary**: This session continues and extends Deep Learning - Part 1 by going into more advanced examples.  Concepts regarding architecture, layers, and applications will be presented.  Additionally, more advanced tutorials and hands-on exercises with larger deep convolutional networks and transfer learning will be executed on GPUs.  There will also be a chance to learn Keras more in depth and become familiar with building more flexible models.
